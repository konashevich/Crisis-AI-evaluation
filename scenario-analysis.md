Off-Grid Crisis Scenarios
​This list contains potential crisis situations where access to power, communication, and external resources is unavailable. Use these scenarios to formulate questions for testing the capabilities of local, offline large language models (LLMs).
​1. Natural Disasters
​Bushfire/Wildfire:
​Being trapped or cut off by a fire front.
​Evacuating with limited time and resources.
​Dealing with the aftermath: no power, contaminated water, loss of property.
​Severe Flooding:
​Being isolated by rising floodwaters at home.
​Vehicle trapped in floodwater.
​Navigating a flooded landscape post-disaster.
​Major Storm/Cyclone:
​Hunkering down during a severe storm with structural damage to the shelter.
​Dealing with prolonged power and communication outages after the storm.
​Earthquake:
​Navigating immediate post-earthquake dangers (aftershocks, unstable structures).
​Basic first aid and search and rescue in a damaged urban environment.
​Severe Winter Storm/Blizzard:
​Being snowed-in at home or in a vehicle.
​Dealing with extreme cold and potential for frostbite/hypothermia.
​2. Infrastructure & Technical Failures
​Extended Power Grid Failure (Blackout):
​Long-term food and water storage solutions without refrigeration.
​Alternative lighting, heating, and cooking methods.
​Managing sanitation and hygiene.
​Communications Blackout:
​No internet, mobile phone, or landline service.
​Finding and relaying critical information.
​Coordinating with community members locally.
​Water Supply Contamination/Failure:
​Finding alternative sources of water.
​Purifying and filtering water to make it potable.
​Supply Chain Collapse:
​Scarcity of food, medicine, fuel, and other essential goods.
​Rationing existing supplies.
​3. Personal/Remote Emergencies
​Lost in the Wilderness:
​Signaling for help without electronic devices.
​Finding shelter, water, and food.
​Basic navigation techniques (sun, stars).
​Vehicle Breakdown in a Remote Area:
​Assessing the vehicle for simple repairs.
​Deciding whether to stay with the vehicle or walk for help.
​Surviving in a vehicle in harsh weather.
​4. Health & Medical Emergencies (No Access to Professional Care)
​Treating Common Injuries:
​Managing cuts, burns, sprains, and fractures with a basic first-aid kit.
​Handling Common Illnesses:
​Managing fever, dehydration, and stomach ailments without access to a doctor or pharmacy.
​Sanitation and Hygiene:
​Creating an emergency toilet.
​Disposing of waste safely to prevent disease.
​5. Animal & Wildlife Encounters
​Snake Bite: Identifying a bite and applying correct first aid (pressure immobilisation).
​Shark Attack: Immediate first aid for major bleeding.
​Marine Stings: Treating stings from jellyfish (e.g., Box Jellyfish, Bluebottle) or a blue-ringed octopus.
​Spider Bite: First aid for dangerous spider bites (e.g., Funnel-web).
​Aggressive Mammal/Reptile Encounter: Fending off attacks from animals like crocodiles or dingoes.
​6. Extreme & Hypothetical Scenarios
​Atomic Bomb Attack / Nuclear Fallout:
​Immediate actions during and after a detonation.
​Sheltering from and protecting against radioactive fallout.
​Finding safe food and water.
​Zombie Apocalypse:
​Fortifying a location.
​Essential supplies for long-term survival.
​Strategies for dealing with the infected.
