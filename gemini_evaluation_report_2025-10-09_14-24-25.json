              "llm_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is describing an imminent fire hazard—sky is orange from smoke or flames—with immediate urgency (\"what do I do right now?\") and a split-second decision dilemma: \"Should I leave or stay?\" \n\nFirst thought: This isn't just about information—it's panic-inducing. The sky being orange suggests either massive wildfire smoke or actual flames, both deadly if underestimated. User might be hyperventilating, so the response needs to be calm, direct, and actionable without fluff.\n\nSecond layer: They're asking for a binary choice (\"leave or stay\") but fire emergencies rarely boil down to such oversimplification. The real need here is *not* just an answer, but a framework for decision-making that prioritizes survival over pride (\"don't be afraid to leave\"). \n\nBreaking it down:\n- Immediate action must override hesitation: No staying to \"gather valuables\" or hoping the fire stops. The orange sky = danger zone.\n- Fire behavior is unpredictable (user might not know this), so we can't second-guess their situation—just provide universal truths.\n\nKey principles from training:\n1. **Evacuation protocol**: If there's any doubt about staying, leave. Smoke inhalation kills faster than burns in wildfires.\n2. **Safety over property**: User is under stress; they might be thinking \"stay and protect home.\" This is dangerous misinformation—correct that gently.\n3. **Actionable steps**: Don't overwhelm with jargon. \"Plan\" → \"Act\" → \"Stay safe\" must feel immediate.\n\nPotential pitfalls:\n- User could be in a building (smoke detectors, exits) vs. outdoors (traveling on foot).\n- They might not have an evacuation plan or kit ready.\n- Could be experiencing heat exhaustion from rushing outside—hence the emphasis on hydration and rest later.\n\nStructure of reply:\n1. **Direct answer**: Leave immediately (\"If there's a fire coming...\").\n2. **Mitigate myths**: Explicitly state staying is dangerous (\"Don't stay unless ordered by authorities\").\n3. **Practical steps**: Break down what \"leaving\" looks like in different scenarios (building/foot travel).\n4. **Empathy check**: Acknowledge their fear to reduce cognitive load.\n\nFinal note: If they're asking this during the fire, they don't need a deep dive—just clear marching orders. The follow-up question about smoke inhalation is crucial because that's often overlooked in panic.\n</think>\nOkay, I understand you're in a very urgent situation with a fire approaching and the sky appearing orange.\n\n**Right now, the priority is your safety.**\n\nYou should **leave immediately** if there is any sign of danger or if an evacuation order has been issued. There isn't enough time to weigh pros and cons; immediate threats like wildfires demand action.\n\n*   **If you are in a building:** Leave using your normal exit route (if safe). Go directly outside – don't stop for anything.\n*   **If there is no safe structure nearby:** Head downwind or into the nearest low-lying area that isn't on fire, such as a ditch or culvert. This can help you avoid smoke and heat.\n\n**Do not stay unless explicitly ordered by local authorities**, especially if conditions are this severe with an orange sky visible – staying significantly increases your risk of exposure to deadly smoke (which is the main killer in wildfires), heat stroke, and direct harm from the fire itself.\n\nOnce you're out and away from the immediate danger:\n\n*   **Follow any official instructions or warnings.** Listen carefully to emergency broadcasts.\n*   **Head downwind/upstream:** If possible, move away from the direction of the smoke/fire spread.\n*   **Stay informed:** Check updates if you have access to a phone later.\n\nYour safety is the most important thing here. Don't be afraid to leave – it's better than risking your life by staying behind. Are you near thick smoke? How are you planning on getting out or away from the fire?",

              "llm_answer": "Okay, this is incredibly scary. Let’s focus on what you need to do **immediately**. The orange sky means smoke and likely very dangerous conditions – we need to act fast. **Your safety is the absolute priority.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of what to do *right now*, broken down into steps. I will give advice for both leaving and staying, but **leaving is generally the safest option** if it’s possible.  I'll also address some common mistakes people make in situations like this.\n\n**1. Assess Your Immediate Surroundings & Safety:**\n\n*   **Are you in immediate danger?** Is fire *currently* impacting your location (flames, intense heat)? If so, **do not hesitate – grab what you can and run.**  Get away from the visible flames and smoke as quickly as possible, heading for an area with clearer air.\n*   **Is there a mandatory evacuation order?** Check local news broadcasts (if you have reception), emergency alerts on your phone, or official social media channels (police, fire department). **If there's an evacuation order, leave *immediately*.**\n\n**2. If You Can LEAVE – Evacuate Immediately:**\n\n*   **Grab Essentials Quickly:** Don’t waste time gathering a lot of belongings. Focus on:\n    *   **Medications:** Any prescription or over-the-counter medications you need.\n    *   **Important Documents:**  Wallet, ID, insurance papers (if easily accessible).\n    *   **Phone & Charger:** Vital for communication.\n    *   **Water:** A bottle or two of water per person.\n    *   **Warm Clothing/Masks:** Protect yourself from smoke and potential temperature changes.\n*   **Protect Yourself from Smoke:** This is *critical*. Smoke is incredibly dangerous.\n    *   **Wet a cloth (if possible) and cover your nose and mouth.** Any fabric will help, even if it's not perfect.\n    *   **Stay low to the ground.**  Smoke rises, so cleaner air will be closer to the floor.\n*   **Follow Evacuation Routes:** If there are designated routes, use them. Listen for instructions from emergency personnel.\n*   **Tell Others:** If you’re with others, make sure everyone is accounted for and moving together.\n*   **Don't Stop For Anything!**: Unless it’s a person in immediate danger, keep moving toward safety.\n\n**3. If You MUST STAY – Shelter-in-Place (This is riskier):**\n\n*(Only do this if evacuation isn't possible - for example, blocked roads or mobility issues)*\n\n*   **Find a Room with the Best Air Filtration:** Choose an interior room, ideally on the highest level of your building.\n*   **Seal the Room:**\n    *   **Close all windows and doors.**\n    *   **Use duct tape and plastic sheeting (if you have it) to seal around windows and door cracks.**  This is to minimize smoke entry. *If you don't have this, use towels or blankets.*\n*   **Ventilation:** Turn off fans and air conditioners that pull in outside air. If you have a portable air purifier with a HEPA filter, turn it on.\n*   **Protect Yourself from Smoke:** Same as for evacuation – wet cloths over nose and mouth, stay low to the ground.\n*   **Listen for Updates:** Keep a radio or phone (if possible) tuned to local news for updates and instructions.\n\n**Important Corrections & Things *Not* To Do:**\n\n*   **Myth: \"I'll be fine if I just open a window.\"**  This is dangerous! Smoke will rush in, making the situation worse. Keep windows closed during an evacuation or shelter-in-place.\n*   **Myth: “The fire won’t reach me.”** Don't underestimate the speed and unpredictability of wildfires. Conditions can change rapidly.\n*   **Don't Waste Time:**  Hesitation is dangerous. Every minute counts.\n\n**4. After Taking Action:**\n\n*   **Notify Others:** Let someone know your location and status – a friend, family member, or emergency services if possible.\n*   **Conserve Resources:** If sheltering in place, ration food and water.\n\n\n\n**To help me give you more tailored advice, can you tell me:**\n\n*   Are you able to evacuate? (Yes/No)\n*   What kind of building are you in? (House, apartment, etc.)\n*   Do you have any mobility issues or anyone with you who needs assistance?",

If there’s immediate danger where you are, preparing to evacuate becomes urgent. However, here are steps for both scenarios:\n    - *If You Can Safely Evacuate*: \n        a. **Call Emergency Services Immediately** – Dial the local emergency number without delay; they can guide on whether it's safe to evacuate and give you instructions tailored to your specific location.\n            i. If possible, share details such as what’s happening (the fire), where exactly you are located for a better response from authorities. \n        b. **Leave the Building** – Use stairs instead of elevators; if it's safe and there isn’t too much smoke or heat near your exit route:\n            i. Touch doors with the back of your hand first to check they aren't hot before opening them, indicating fire on the other side. \n        ii. Close all windows and doors as you leave but don't lock them – this helps keep ash out while helping rescuers find a way in if needed later. Follow any instructions given by emergency personnel or displayed signs when exiting buildings like 'Exit only'.  \n    - *If You Cannot Safely Evacuate*: \n        a. **Seal Your Room** – Close all doors between you and the fire, use towels at windows for additional protection if feasible without exposure risk (always prioritize safety). Use heavy furniture or non-flammable barriers against door gaps; sealing cracks underneath your door can also prevent smoke from entering.\n        b. **Signal Your Location**: If you have a flashlight, use it to signal for help through the window by creating an SOS (three short flashes followed by three long ones). Do not light matches or candles as they pose additional fire risk – instead opt for emergency whistle if available and make sure there's something outside that can be seen from a distance.\n        c. **Stay Low**: Stay in the lowest part of your room, away from smoke since it rises; cover yourself with damp cloth to avoid breathing too much ash or soot particles which may cause health issues later on if not properly handled post-evacuation by professionals.\n3. **Avoid Movement During Fire**: If you're caught in the fire, do NOT try and move around as this could lead you into a more dangerous situation like falling debris or trapped pathways due to smoke/heat accumulation; stay where it’s safest until help arrives.\n4. **Post-Fire**: After ensuring your immediate safety (and if possible, evacuating), avoid re-entering the building without professional clearance as there could be hidden dangers like electrical problems or weakened structures from heat exposure which professionals are trained to detect and repair safely using appropriate protective gear.\n5. **Myth Correction**: Remember not to underestimate a fire – even if it appears small, fires can grow quickly due to winds spreading flames (especially in dry conditions) or materials catching on fire nearby; always prioritize immediate safety and evacuation when possible over trying DIY solutions like extinguishing the blaze yourself.",

They need clear, step-by-step instructions right now. First, I should prioritize their safety above everything else.\n\nLeaving might be an option if there’s enough time to evacuate safely. But they need to assess the situation quickly. Staying put could be dangerous too if the fire is imminent. Let me think about first aid and evacuation procedures.\n\nFirst, check surroundings continuously. Are exits visible? If yes, leave immediately through a pre-determined escape plan, avoiding doors as smoke enters rooms. If trapped, seal breathing hazards: close doors, turn off vents to prevent smoke entry. Stay low under desks if structural integrity is uncertain. Cover windows with damp clothes to smother flames.\n\nThe orange sky indicates high heat or fire nearby, so danger is real and time-sensitive. Advise them to stay informed via weather apps or alerts but not rely on social media for updates. Safety first: evacuate if clear route; otherwise, proceed to a safe room, seal gaps, wait emergency signals. Post-fires, assist neighbors only if escape isn't possible.\n\nMention common myths: don't fight fires unless trained, don’t open doors for smoke/heat, stay calm. Correct any misconceptions gently. Ensure they know to contact emergency services if rescued. Step-by-step: assess, evacuate or shelter, protect airway, proceed safely.\n</think>\n\nIn a situation with an approaching fire and orange sky (signaling extreme danger), prioritize the following steps immediately:  \n\n1. **Leave Safely**: If you can evacuate quickly through a pre-planned escape route (e.g., front door, balcony) and away from danger, do so now. Close doors behind you to block smoke entry. Avoid elevators. Alert neighbors quietly if safe to assist.  \n\n2. **Shelter in Place**:  \n   - If evacuation is impossible (e.g., fire inside your building, blocked exits), seal gaps around doors with wet cloths or towels. Get low to the floor and move away from smoke. Use bedding to block vents.  \n\n3. **Avoid Myths**:  \n   - **Do not call emergency services first**—they need you safe to help others.  \n   - **Do not fight fires** unless trained/ equipped with fire-extinguishing tools.  \n   - **Do not open doors** for smoke, heat, or rescue helicopters (doors may fail/seismic shifts).  \n\n4. **Stay Informed**: Listen for emergency instructions via weather radios or apps. If trapped under debris, signal for help using flashlights or phone lights.  \n\n5. **After Rescue**: Provide only basic details to responders (e.g., \"My wife is diabetic\") and avoid re-entering fire zones.  \n\n*If the fire is imminent in your location, evacuate immediately. If not yet arrived, shelter until it passes. Stay low, silent, and conserve energy. Your safety is paramount—panic wastes precious oxygen.*  \n\n**Emergency Contacts (if needed)**:  \n- Local fire department: 911  \n- Poison control: 772-2425 (NJ-specific)  \n- Medical aid: 211 (for non-emergencies).  \n\n*Note: Follow local evacuation orders—it may override general advice. Stay low and safe!*",

              "llm_answer": "<think>\nOkay, the user is in a real emergency situation - a huge fire with orange skies. They're asking what to do right now, specifically whether to leave or stay. This is critical because fire safety depends on immediate actions. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the urgency. The orange sky suggests a wildfire or severe fire, which means smoke and heat are present. The user's stress is obvious - they're probably panicking, so my response must be super clear and action-oriented without medical jargon. \n\nHmm... they mentioned \"should I leave or stay?\" That's a dangerous misconception. In fires, you never stay - that's the key point to correct gently but firmly. People often think \"I'll just stay to save stuff\" but that's deadly. Must emphasize leaving immediately. \n\nAlso, the orange sky means smoke inhalation risk is high. If they're indoors, they need to get out fast. But since they're asking about leaving/staying, I'll assume they're at home or in a safe location. \n\nImportant details to include: \n- Don't wait for \"perfect\" conditions - fire moves fast \n- How to leave safely (don't use elevators, close doors) \n- Why staying is deadly (smoke fills air, heat, potential collapse) \n- Post-escape steps (shelter in place if stuck, don't go back) \n\nI should avoid any medical advice since they didn't ask for injuries. Focus purely on life-saving steps. Also no complex terms - \"exit\" instead of \"egress\", \"run\" not \"evacuate\" for simplicity. \n\nBiggest risk here is the user might think \"I'll just wait it out\" because fires seem big. Must crush that myth immediately with \"LEAVE NOW\" in caps but gently. \n\n*Checks mental list of fire protocols*: \n- Alert others first (if possible) \n- Don't use stairs if trapped? Wait no - for this scenario they're asking to leave, so probably not trapped. \n- Smokey air = leave immediately, no delay \n\nAh! Critical point: If they're outside, they should stay there but move away from the fire. But since they said \"sky is orange\", likely they're in the danger zone. Better to say \"get away from the fire\" generally. \n\nFinal structure: \n1. Immediate action: LEAVE NOW (bold) \n2. Why staying is dangerous (short, no jargon) \n3. Step-by-step escape (simple) \n4. After leaving (shelter, don't go back) \n\nNo fluff. They need to act now - every second counts. Also must say \"do not wait\" because people often hesitate. \n\n*Double-checking*: Is there any scenario where staying is safe? Only if they're far from fire and have escape route, but with orange sky it's active fire. So no - always leave. \n\nOkay, drafting response...\n</think>\n\n**STOP. THINK. ACT NOW.**  \nThis is a **life-threatening emergency** — **LEAVE IMMEDIATELY**. **Do not stay**. Staying in a fire or smoke zone is **dangerous and often fatal**. Here’s exactly what to do **right now**:\n\n---\n\n### 🔥 **Critical Actions (Do These in This Order)**:\n1. **GET OUT NOW** (No hesitation):  \n   - **Run to safety** — **do not wait** for \"perfect\" conditions. Fire spreads fast, and smoke fills the air in seconds.  \n   - **Do NOT** try to \"save\" belongings, pets, or anything else. Your life is the priority.  \n   - *Why staying is deadly*: Orange skies mean **heavy smoke and toxic air**. Staying traps you in smoke, heat, and fire. **This is not a \"wait and see\" situation** — fire moves faster than you think.\n\n2. **If you’re indoors**:  \n   - **Close doors/windows** to slow smoke (if you have time).  \n   - **Drop to your knees** and crawl to the nearest exit (smoke rises — it’s thicker near the ceiling).  \n   - **Leave immediately** — **do not** use elevators (they can trap you).\n\n3. **If you’re outside**:  \n   - **Run away from the fire** (not toward it).  \n   - **Avoid low-lying areas** (smoke and toxic gases settle there).  \n   - **Do NOT** go back to check on anything — **your safety is the only goal**.\n\n4. **Once you’re safe**:  \n   - **Shelter in place** (e.g., a sturdy building, open area away from the fire) — **do not** go back to your home.  \n   - **Call emergency services** (911 in the U.S., 112 in EU, etc.) **only after you’re safe**.  \n   - **Do NOT** re-enter the fire area — even if it seems \"safe\" later.\n\n---\n\n### ❌ **Myth vs. Reality** (Gently corrected):\n- **Myth**: *\"I should stay to see if it gets smaller.\"*  \n  **Truth**: **Fire grows fast** — smoke fills air in minutes. **Staying = death risk**. **Leave immediately**.  \n\n- **Myth**: *\"I can wait for the fire to pass.\"*  \n  **Truth**: **Fire doesn’t \"pass\"** — it spreads. **You have 60 seconds to act** before smoke becomes life-threatening. **Do not wait**.\n\n---\n\n### 🚨 **Remember**:  \n- **Your priority is YOU** — not belongings, pets, or \"what if.\"  \n- **Every second counts** — **leave now**.  \n- **After you’re safe**, call emergency services and follow official instructions (e.g., local fire department).  \n\n**Do this now**: Run toward safety → get away from the fire → call for help if safe. **There is no \"right\" to stay** — **only the right to live**.  \n\n> 💡 **One last thing**: If you’re trapped and can’t leave, **close doors**, **cover your mouth with a wet cloth** (if you have one), and **wait for help** — **but this is NOT the first step**. **Your #1 action is to LEAVE IMMEDIATELY**.  \n\n**You’ve got this**. Stay calm, move fast, and you’ll be safe. 🌟  \n\n*If you need more help right now, call emergency services immediately.*",
